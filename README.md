# Synnax Incentive Protocol (Forked and Enhanced from Sanctum Earnestness)

Welcome to the **Synnax Governance Protocol**. This repository contains the mechanics for the $SYN governance token, built to reward meaningful contributions and foster long-term community engagement.

---

## Overview

The Synnax Governance protocol draws inspiration from the original **Sanctum design**, but with significant improvements. While both protocols align incentives with meaningful contributions, Synnax introduces two core innovations:

- **Challengeable Social Rank Scores** – A post-publication challenge window allowing users to dispute fraudulent scores.
- **Dynamic Multiplier System** – A flexible mechanism that rewards consistent, impactful contributions in real time.

## Why and How Synnax’s System Improves on Sanctum’s Earnestness Model

The Sanctum model faced key challenges, which Synnax aims to address:

- **Human farming exploits:**  
  Organized groups manipulated participation scores to claim large portions of the airdrop.

- **Opaque evaluation process:**  
  Users lacked the ability to challenge bot-driven or fraudulent activity, causing frustration over fairness.

Synnax introduces a **scalable, dynamic reward mechanism** that ensures **real-time participation tracking** and includes a **14-day challenge window**. This empowers the community to **identify and oppose fraudulent scores**, ensuring rewards are **transparent, fair, and aligned with long-term growth**.

## Key Differences: Synnax’s Dynamic Multiplier System vs. Sanctum's Earnestness

1. **Real-Time Scaling of Rewards**  
   - Synnax tracks contributions dynamically using a **logarithmic multiplier formula**:
     ```math
     Multiplier = Base + log(1 + Contribution Impact)
     ```
   - This ensures even small contributions add value, with larger efforts earning greater rewards over time.

2. **Automated Evaluation**  
   - Unlike Sanctum’s manual review process, Synnax automates reward calculations, ensuring **faster and unbiased distribution**.

3. **Incentivizing Long-Term Engagement**  
   - Rewards in Synnax **scale with continued participation**, encouraging users to remain active over time.

4. **Bonus Structure for Sustained Effort**  
   - Users engaging in at least **three governance proposals** receive a **10% bonus** on accumulated rewards.

5. **Appealable Social Scores**  
   - Participants can **challenge fraudulent or bot-driven scores** within a 14-day window, fostering trust and transparency.

## Why These Changes Matter

The **Dynamic Multiplier System** ensures that Synnax remains adaptive, rewarding both **initial and sustained contributions**. By automating and scaling rewards, the protocol encourages participants to **stay engaged continuously**. This transition from static rewards to dynamic scaling fosters a more **engaging, transparent, and fair governance experience**.

   Connect your social accounts and initialize your engagement score (currently in development).

2. **Contribute to Governance:**  
   Participate in governance discussions, proposals, or help onboard new users.

3. **Monitor Your Rank:**  
   Track your engagement score regularly. Use the 14-day challenge window to dispute any fraudulent activity.
