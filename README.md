# Synnax Incentive (Forked and Modified from Sanctum Earnestness)

Welcome to the **Synnax Governance Protocol**. This repository houses the core structure and mechanics for the $SYN governance token—a **fork of the Sanctum $CLOUD initiative**—enhanced to promote fairness, transparency, and sustained user engagement.

---

## Overview

The Synnax Governance protocol integrates key principles from the original Sanctum $CLOUD design. Both protocols aim to reward meaningful contributions and align user incentives with long-term community growth.

However, Synnax introduces two significant enhancements:

- **Challengeable Social Rank Scores** – A post-publication challenge window allowing users to appeal their scores.
- **Dynamic Multiplier System** – A flexible mechanism to reward consistent, impactful contributions over time.

## Improvements Over $CLOUD Governance

### How Synnax's System Differs from Sanctum’s Earnestness Model

The **Sanctum $CLOUD model** focused on **Earnestness**, rewarding meaningful contributions through a **manual and retrospective process**. Synnax addresses key limitations of that model to introduce a **scalable, dynamic reward mechanism**.

---

### Key Differences: Synnax’s Dynamic Multiplier System vs. Sanctum's Earnestness

1. **Real-Time Scaling of Rewards**  
   - In Synnax, rewards **scale automatically** based on a participant’s growing contributions.  
   - Instead of **manual evaluation** by a team, Synnax applies a **logarithmic multiplier formula** to track participation in real-time.

     **Formula:**  
     ```math
     Multiplier = Base + log(1 + Contribution Impact)
     ```

     This approach ensures that **every small contribution adds value**, with larger efforts earning **more significant rewards over time**.

2. **No Manual Bottleneck**  
   - Sanctum relied on human review, which slowed down reward distribution.  
   - Synnax **automates reward calculations**, ensuring **faster and fairer distribution** without human bottlenecks.

3. **Incentivizing Long-Term Engagement**  
   - While Sanctum’s model rewarded past efforts, Synnax ensures **ongoing rewards for continued participation**.  
   - Participants can earn rewards over time through **consistent involvement** in governance discussions, proposals, and community activities.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment through Multiplier Bonuses**  
   - Synnax participants can **boost rewards** through additional engagement.  
   - For example, users involved in **at least three governance proposals** earn a **10% bonus** on accumulated rewards.

5. **Appealable Social Scores**  
   - Sanctum’s Earnestness scores were final, with no way to challenge them.  
   - Synnax offers a **14-day challenge window** where participants can appeal their rank if they believe their contributions were overlooked.

## Summary of Improvements

| **Aspect**                     | **Sanctum Earnestness**                 | **Synnax Dynamic Multiplier**                |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Reward Timing**               | Retrospective, one-time                 | Continuous, real-time scaling               |
| **Evaluation Process**          | Manual, human-reviewed                  | Automated, formula-based                    |
| **Long-Term Incentives**        | Static, rewards decrease over time      | Dynamic, rewards grow with ongoing effort   |
| **Bonus Structure**             | None                                    | 10% bonus for sustained participation       |
| **Appeal Process**              | None                                    | 14-day challenge window for score review    |

## Why These Changes Matter

The **Dynamic Multiplier System** ensures that Synnax is more **adaptive** to active participants, rewarding both initial and sustained contributions. By **automating rewards and scaling them over time**, the system encourages users to **stay engaged**. This transition from **static rewards to dynamic scaling** fosters a **more engaging and fair governance experience.**

---

## How to Participate

1. **Create a Profile:**  
   Connect your social accounts and initialize your engagement score (in Development).

2. **Contribute to Governance:**  
   Participate in discussions, governance proposals, or help onboard new users.

3. **Monitor Your Rank:**  
   Check your score regularly. If needed, submit a challenge during the 14-day window.

4. **Maximize Your Rewards:**  
   Stay engaged to unlock higher rewards through the dynamic multiplier system and governance bonuses.
