# Synnax Incentives (Forked and Enhanced from Sanctum Earnestness)

Welcome to the **Synnax Governance Protocol**. This repository contains the mechanics for the $SYN governance token, built to reward meaningful contributions and foster long-term community engagement.



## Overview

The Synnax Governance protocol draws inspiration from the **Sanctum Earnestness model**, enhancing it by addressing its challenges and shortcomings. Synnax rewards both **monetary** and **social contributions**, with key improvements to scalability, transparency, and fairness.



## Key changes

1. **Monetary XP and Real-Time Rank Updates**  
   - Monetary contributions (e.g., staking, minting) grant **instant XP**, with ranks updating **in real time**.
   - Contributors can monitor their performance through a **public monetary leaderboard**.

2. **Improved Social Contribution Evaluation**  
   - Social contributions are evaluated **retroactively** to ensure meaningful efforts are rewarded.  
   - The results will not be part of a public leaderboard and may be **announced at the team’s discretion** to prevent gaming the system.

3. **Challengeable Social Contribution Scores**  
   - A **14-day challenge window** allows community members to dispute fraudulent or bot-driven contributions, promoting transparency and trust.



## Addressing Sanctum’s Weaknesses


1. **Manipulation and Exploits:**  
   - Users **gamed the social contribution scores** by creating **farms of artificial participation** through bots and sybil attacks.  
   - Some participants **deleted posts or inflated engagement metrics**, further skewing scores in their favor. 

2. **Lack of Transparency:**  
   - Sanctum failed to **clearly communicate how social scores were evaluated**, leaving contributors frustrated and disillusioned with the process.  
   - This **opaque system fueled distrust** among users and made it difficult to validate genuine contributions, ultimately weakening community alignment.
  

## **Synnax’s Improvements: Transparent Social Contribution Rewards**

1. **Careful Vetting with Retroactive Reviews and Challenges:**  
   - Synnax performs **retroactive evaluations** to reward only **meaningful contributions** aligned with the project’s long-term goals.  
   - A **14-day challenge window** allows users to dispute suspicious activities like **bots, sybil attacks, or deleted posts**, ensuring transparency and fairness.  

2. **Balanced Incentives for Monetary and Social Contributions:**  
   - **Monetary contributions** receive **instant on-chain XP**, updating ranks in real-time to keep financial supporters engaged.  
   - **Social rewards** are awarded **after evaluation**, ensuring authenticity and preventing manipulation.  

This approach ensures **fair recognition** for both financial and social efforts while empowering the community to **maintain accountability**.




## Reward System Overview

### **Monetary Contributions (Instant XP)**

Monetary contributions are rewarded instantly, creating real-time feedback loops for users.

- **XP Allocation Examples:**  
  - Minting : +2 XP per $100 minted
  - Staking: +5 XP per $100 staked per day
  - Liquidity Provision: +8 XP per $100 added per day 
  
- **Public Monetary Leaderboard:**  
  - Contributors can track their performance and rank in real-time.



### **Social Contributions (Retroactive XP)**

Synnax’s social rewards are **not immediately published**. Instead, contributions are carefully evaluated during review period. 

- **Examples of Social Contributions:**  
  - Hosting AMAs or events  
  - Creating educational content or translating official documents  
  - Proposing and supporting governance initiatives  

- **Bonus for Governance Participation:**  
  - Participants engaging in **at least three proposals** during a review period. 

- **Challenge Window:**  
  - After each review cycle, there is a **14-day challenge period** to flag any fraudulent or improper contributions for investigation.

   Connect your wallet and social accounts (X or Discord) to Synnax to begin tracking contributions.

2. **Contribute Financially:**  
   Mint syUSD, provide liquidity or trade on DEX to earn **instant XP** and track your rank on the **public monetary leaderboard**.
